[So let's think about *the meaning of life*.](#act2a_meaning)

# act2a_social

b: They're secretly gossiping about you!

b: They're talking behind your back IN FRONT OF YOUR BACK

b: We're just bringing this party down by being around here. Human, we have to leave *now* before--

# act2a_perv

b: // pokemon?

b: They're more attractive than you, which means if you so much as *look* at them,

b: then YOU'RE A CREEP

(#act2b)

# act2a_meaning

b: What can we possibly do that matters in the grand scheme of things?

b: Even if we somehow change the course of humanity, all of humanity will die one day.

b: Humanity dies, the sun dies, the entire universe dies, what the hell are we supposed to--

[I must warn you *louder!*](#act2b_louder)

# act2b_louder_social

b: EMOTIONS ARE CONTAGIOUS! SO IF YOU DON'T LEAVE YOU'LL INFECT EVERYONE WITH YOUR MENTAL ILLNESS! 

b: You'll create a deadly outbreak of SAD LUMP SYNDROME

b: We need to get out of here and quarantine ourselves forever in a small room with Netflix and food delivery!

(#act2c)

# act2b_louder_perv

b: DON'T BE A CREEP. IT'S AGAINST THE LAW!

b: Creep Law, Section 74.5: (1) Any Person who checks out (a) that sweet ass (b) those ripped arms (2) shall be hereby referred to as

# act2b_louder_meaning

b: BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S WORSE THAN HAVING NO IMPACT? HAVING *ALL* THE IMPACT.

b: Alfred Nobel wanted world peace, and for cultures to understand each other. So he decided to make travel easier. So he needed a way to cheaply create train tunnels. So he invented a new material called "dynamite"...

b: ...which was used in World War I to KILL MILLIONS OF PEOPLE

b: IT'S THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT, HUMAN! HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE YOU ACCIDENTALLY KILLING RIGHT NOW

(#act2c)

# act2b_different_social

b: Actually, you know what's worse than no-one liking you? _Everyone_ liking you.

b: That is, if you become like one of _these_ shallow party animals. A shallow life with shallow friends who only know the shallow you!

b: Human, we need to get away from these dopamine zombies before they turn us into one of them!

(#act2c)

# act2b_different_moral

b: People are dying in famines and genocides *right now* and you're just partying!

b: A wise person once said, "the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good folks to do nothing."

b: YOU'RE DOING NOTHING.

b: BY PARTYING, YOU'RE HELPING *HITLER*.

(#act2c)

#act2c_louder

// 6 possibilities

# act2c_louder_netflix

b: Actually, is Netflix and food delivery quarantined enough?! We'd still infect the delivery person!

b: We need to move out to the middle of the Canadian Yukon territories, and have our food delivered to us by drone!

b: And then they'd have to sterilize the drone after each use to rid it of your SAD LUMP GERMS

# act2c_louder_law

b: The BIG DISGUSTING TRASH PERVERT shall be sentenced to no less than five (5) years in one of those medieval public-humiliation things where people throw rotten fruit at them

b: unless they're actually _into_ that sort of thing

b: in which case that further proves them being a BIG DISGUSTING TRASH PERVERT

# act2c_louder_butterfly

b: BUTTERFLY EFFECT! Did you drive to this party in your fossil-fuel car?

b: BAM, ONE KID DROWNED IN FLORIDA.

b: Remember that time you said that mean thing to that stranger?

b: BAM, THEY'RE PROBABLY SUICIDED BY NOW

(#act2d)


# act2c_louder_zombies

b: These popularity-zombies will stumble towards you mumbling,

b: LIIIIIKES. LIIIIIIIIIIKES.

b: And they'll bite you and turn you into a brainless bro and/or thoughtless thot!

(#act2d)

# act2c_louder_hitler

b: THE NAZIS ARE GOOSE-STEPPING BACK ON THE STREETS RIGHT NOW

b: And they're saying:

b: *Good thing those 'good folks' slacked off with crap like 'relaxing' and 'self-care'!*

b: *Now our plans can go fourth, reich on schedule!*

(#act2d)

# act2c_louder_ignore

b: Come to think about it, do we know if this building _has_ a monoxide detector?!

b: What if we're all being poisoned *RIGHT NOW?*

(#act2d)

# act2c_different_social

b: What if we're just _fundamentally incapable_ of ever being loved, or loving another?

b: What if something irreversibly broke inside of us a long time ago? Or what if that something never existed in us in the first place?

b: Oh god we're broken! We're so broken so broken so brok--

(#act2d)

# act2c_different_moral

b: What if we're just _fundamentally rotten?_ Other people have a strong inner drive to do goodness, but we only do "good" out of guilt or shame, if at all.

b: What if it's in our nature to hurt others? What if we can't be anything _other_ than a burden to those close to us?

b: Oh god we're broken! We're so broken so broken so brok--

(#act2d)

# act2c_punch

b: Like, I'm not being irrational here. People _do_ actually drug in punch bowls. That is an actual danger.

h: FUCK!

h: FUCKING FUCK-FUKKITY _FUUUUUCK_

b: Oh thank goodness, human! I'm so glad you can finally hear me again!

b: Why did you try ignoring me?

h: Holy whoring hell, you stupid sack of shit.

h: You know that Native American story? "There are two wolves inside you, one is hope, one is despair. Which wolf wins? The one you feed."

h: I was trying to fucking _starve_ you, you sadistic asshole.

h: Fuck it, I'll do positive affirmations instead.

h: *I am loved. I am good. I am smart. I am beautiful. I am special.*

[You know "affirmations" were disproven, right?](#act2d_disproven)

[Golly, human, you're becoming a narcissist!](#act2d_narcissist)

[ohmygod you can't just credit every "wise" story to Native Americans](#act2d_racist)

# act2d_disproven

b: In fact, they actually _backfire_ for people with low self-esteem! 

b: It was a well-designed study â€“ randomized controlled trial, experimenter was blinded as to who was in which group. Here's what they found. If you already had low self-esteem, being asked to repeat affirmations makes you feel *worse* than if you'd said nothing at all!

b: Wood et al, 2009. Look it up on Google Scholar, human,

b: THEN STOP SPREADING UNSCIENTIFIC FAKE NEWS

(#act2e)

# act2d_narcissist

b: You _need_ to humbly see your own flaws in order to grow as a person!

b: You can't spray air freshener over a moldy room! Covering up your flaws with these narcissistic statements will make you worse in the long-run.

b: Thankfully, I, as your loyal guard-wolf, can alert you to your flaws. And right now, it's-

b: EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING IS WRONG

(#act2e)

# act2d_racist

b: Native Americans are, like, _actual people_, not a bunch of "noble savages" you can namedrop to make your fortune-cookie advice sound more _exotic_.

b: You're reducing individual persons & complex cultures to a Hallmark card! That's "benevolent racism", human! 

b: STOP BEING RACIST YOU SQUINTY-EYED JERK

h: FUCKDAMMIT.

h: You know what? You're _irrational._

h: Everyone already knows emotions are irrational! Especially fear!

h: Why should I listen to a moron shitstain like you?!

b: ...

[...Jeez human. That's really hurtful to say.]()

[Human, I'm in your brain. We're equally rational.]()

[Wait, what happened to "your feelings are valid"?]()

# act2e_hurtful

b: I'm _part_ of you, you know. When you say that, you're hurting _yourself._

b: Why are you hitting yourself, human? STOP HITTING YOURSELF.

(#act2f)

# act2e_rational

b: Which means if _I'm_ irrational, then _you're_ irrational!

b: And if we're both so dumb and stupid, we'll never figure out how to be happy! Oh god we're so lost! So lost so lost so los--

(#act2f)

# act2e_valid

b: So "they" say that emotions are irrational, that emotions are not to be trusted.

b: But "they" _also_ say that feelings are valid, that you should always accept your emotions.

b: Maybe "they" are just full of crap! "They" have fed hurtful lies to you your whole life!

h: ...

b: Well maybe you're NOT _SUPPOSED_ TO GET RID ME.

b: Jeez, how do you think _I_ feel, human?!

b: I'm trying my best to be your guard-dog, but you keep seeing me as some Big Bad Wolf!

b: So I try even _harder_ to alert you to danger. More danger! Louder danger! But no matter how hard I try, you _still_ think of me as your enemy!

b: Sure, I raise false alarms sometimes. Maybe even most of the time!

b: But I'm _trying_, human.

b: ...I'm trying.

c: Hey.

c: It seems like you're caught up in an argument with yourself.

h2: (nods)

c: You're not alone, kid. Anxiety is super common.

c: Heck, just yesterday, I heard someone on campus had a nervous breakdown and smashed their phone / curled up into a ball and cried!

h2: ...huh imagine that.

c: That's why I host all these parties. I want to help people be happy.

h2: ...but my anxiety...

c: Don't worry, buddy. There's actually a very simple trick to get the negative voices in your head to be quiet forever.

c: (gives bottle)
