# act4

h: Welp.

h: You were right.

h: I *was* being an idiot, my so-called friends *were* using me, and we almost fucking *died*.

// h: I *was* being an idiot, my so-called friends *were* using me, and I almost jumped off a fucking *roof*.

// TODO: stuff isn't as scary once you've had that experience

[Yeah, not to mention the hospital bill.]()

// [Not to mention the damage you did to your liver.]()

[Yeah, that *was* the worst-case scenario.]()

[Yeah, I was right.]()

# act4a_bill

h: Right. I don't think my health insurance covers "being a dumbass".

b: And it doesn't cover "literally being dead"! Which we could've been!

(#act4b)

# act4a_liver

b: We definitely shaved a few years off our life expectancy...

b: But... at least we still *have* a life expectancy!

(#act4b)

# act4a_worst

b: And yet...

h: Hm?

b: ...and yet, we survived.

(#act4b)

# act4a_right

b: But... you were right, too.

h: Hm?

b: I *was* the wolf who cried wolf. I kept barking at nothing, so when *actual* danger came, you didn't believe me.

b: The worst possible danger did, in fact, happen.

h: ...

b: ...

b: And yet, we survived!

(#act4b)

# act4b

b: That could have gone so much worse! But it didn't. We're still here.

// b: We were *this* close to actually dying! But we didn't. We're still here.

h: We're still here.

b: And we don't have to fight.

(...5000)

b: I'm not a Big Bad Wolf. But I'm not a guard-wolf either.

b: I'm a battered shelter dog.

b: We've been through some rough stuff in life, so that's why whenever I sense the slightest danger I over-react and go--

b: YAP YAP YAP YAP YAP

b: But I don't *want* to be a cowardly dog! I want to protect you! I want to be a good dog!

b: Human... will you help tame me?

h: I...

h: ...don't know how.

h: But we can fake it until we make it.

h: Okay. So, I'd like to have a healthy relationship with my negative emotions... and healthy relationships need good communication. So, let's communicate.

h: Dear inner wolf... how are *you* feeling?

n: YOUR TOTAL FEARS USED:

n: //info

n: WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT FIRST? (YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE OTHERS LATER)

[I'm scared we'll be harmed.]()

[I'm scared we'll be alone.]()

[I'm scared we're bad people.]()

# act4_harm
 
// b: news story, fire exit, serial killer, sedentary, w/e

b: ...God, there's so many dangerous things in the world!

// b: I dunno, what do *you* think, human?

[You're right. So how can we better defend ourselves?]()

[I think we should expose ourselves to *more* danger.]()

[Thank you.]()

# act4_harm_skills

b: Well... I *do* have claws & fangs, but I'm just a metaphor for the fight-flight circuit in your brain.

h: We could take a self-defense class? Try improving our general health? Learn to better assert our boundaries of what we feel safe with?

b: Maybe, but...

[Where do we even start?]()

[What if they still don't work?]()

[What if we go overboard on "safety"?]()

# act4_harm_skills_start

b: There's so much to do, so much we need to fix about ourselves. What do we even *begin* with?

h: We're beginning right now.

b: Eh?

h: I mean, we're practicing good communication right now. And if that works, we can detect danger better with fewer false positives... and *does* help protect us from harm!

h: This *is* self-defense training.

b: Huh. I was expecting more of this:

(HI YAAAA)

h: Heh.

# act4_harm_skills_work

h: True, there's no way to 100% protect ourselves...

h: But even a 1% improvement is still worth something, right?

b: You're seeing the glass as not 99% empty, but 1% full.

h: Which is still worth something if you're stranded in the desert.

b: Heh. Bottoms up, then.

# act4_harm_skills_overboard

b: I mean, the whole reason you ignored my warnings earlier was *because* I went overboard with safety! 

b: I *am* your fear, and now I fear fear itself!

h: Naw, you're right, that's a good point. We have to also do safety in moderation. Everything in moderation.

b: Sorry, *EVERYTHING* in moderation?

h: *A moderate number of things* in moderation.

b: Thank you for making your statements recursively self-consistent.

# act4_harm_exposure

b: WHAT // shock

h: I mean, for example, let's say a dog is scared of thunder. One trick trainers use is to play a recording of thunder at a low volume, then give the dog a treat for staying calm.

h: Over several days, the trainer will raise the volume, and the dog learns to stay calm with louder and louder sounds, until the dog has overcome their fear of thunder.

h: It's called exposure therapy!

h: If it works for _literal_ dogs, it should work for you, my metaphorical mind-dog. Right? All mammals have the same fight-or-flight response.

[I'm a wolf, not a dog.]()

[What if we desensitize ourselves *too* much?]()

[What if we expose ourselves to a *real* danger?]()

# act4_harm_exposure_dog

h: And I'll show you affection and patience 'til you're domesticated into a cute lil' puppy.

b: ...

b: D'aw.

# act4_harm_exposure_overboard

b: We *just* saw what happens if you ignore or shut down your fear – you put yourself in *actually* dangerous situations.

b: Besides, won't *too* much desensitization turn us into psychopaths? Soon we'll be giving ourselves treats while watching snuff murder porn!

h: I... think there's a line between that and the thunder.

b: But *where*, human?! *Where?*

h: I don't know. But you can help me! Based on what you're okay with for now, we'll find and draw that line.

b: Okay. But I have no opposable thumbs, so you have to draw for me.

# act4_harm_exposure_hurt

b: For example: we almost jumped off a freaking *roof!*

// b: For example: we jumped off a *roof!*

h: No, you're right. We *can* go too far.

h: But that's why, if we do exposure therapy, we'll have to start very very very small, and make very small steps upward.

h: When we start hitting *actual* danger, we stop.

b: Yeah I'd draw the line somewhere between hearing loud thunder, and standing in a lightning storm with a tall pointy hat.

# act4_thanks

b: ...

b: Wait, no arguments for or against what I'm feeling? Just... "thank you"?

h: Yeah! Thank you for showing your concern for my physical safety / social life / moral well-being.

b: ...

h: You okay?

b: You've never said *thank you* to me before.

h: Aw you big fuzzy-wuzzy panic-wolf.

# act4_thanks_2

h: Even if you over-react a lot, I'm glad you look out for my physical safety / social life / moral well-being.

b: Wait... you're not just repeating "thank you" to avoid actually talking about these concerns, are you?

h: Well, feelings are complicated, and I don't always have answers for you.

h: It's not like life gives you a list of 3 pre-made dialogue responses.

h: But short of a "real" answer, for now, I can at least say thanks for watching out for me.

b: Well, I know I can be full of crud sometimes, so thanks for listening to me – patiently, non-judgmentally.

b: You small hairless flesh-mammal.

# act4_thanks_3

h: Even if your yapping scares me, you're simply trying to protect my physical safety / social life / moral well-being.

b: Okay seriously, if you keep flattering me like this, people are gonna get weird ideas about us.

h: Oh come on, I'm just a vulnerable college-age kid and you're a big, scary wolf. What's the worst that cou--

h: Actually, do not answer that.


# act4_alone

// callbacks

b: Will we be loved? *Can* we be loved?

b: I dunno, what do *you* think, human?
// Again, back to you, human. What do you think?
// Thoughts, human?

[I agree that I'd like to work on our social skills.]()

[I'm sure people like us. Let's find out?]()

[Thank you.]()

# act4_alone_skills

h: We could practice – I dunno – starting conversations, sharing common interests, listening, empathizing, asking questions? 

h: Maybe try improv or public speaking so we can get comfortable being in front of – and making mistakes in front of – other people?

b: IMPROV IS A CULT // fingerpoint

b: But, besides...

[Won't learning "social skills" make us *manipulative?*]()

[Won't being friendly make us *easier to manipulate?*]()

[What if we try to get better, and still fail?]()

# act4_alone_skills_manipulative

b: Aren't serial killers who can read their victims' emotions great at "empathy"? Didn't Charles Manson win friends and influence people?

h: No, you're right.

h: "Social skills" mean nothing if we don't genuinely care *for* people.

h: But caring for people requires opening up, and opening up *is* a skill that needs to be learnt, and *can* be learnt.

b: Crack us open like a coconut.

# act4_alone_skills_manipulated

b: We'll become a Welcome doormat, saying Please and Thank You as people wipe their feet on us!

b: We'll kiss so much ass it'll look like we're wearing brown lipstick!

h: Nah, you're right. "Social skills" can't be just about pleasing others, it's also got to be about setting personal boundaries.

h: We can't invite others into our home, if we have no walls to hold up a home.

h: ...also, re: the lipstick mental image... *ew??*

# act4_alone_skills_fail

h: We might.

h: But, I still wanna give it a shot. If we're going to socially strike out, I'd like to go out swinging.

b: Yeah I guess worst case we can just skip town and change our identity.

b: I think that only costs half a bitcoin these days.

# act4_alone_experiment

h: We could try some experiments!

h: We could ping a friend to hang out, reconnect with someone close to us, or even just strike a conversation with a barista or something.

h: I think we may find we're more likable than we suspect.

[What if these experiments fail?]()

[What if these are just small, cheap "wins"?]()

[What if us being social is a burden to others?]()

# act4_alone_experiment_fail

b: The experiment finds no effect, and scientific journals won't publish our null result! // cry

h: You're right, it *could* fail!

h: It's not a true experiment if it can't fail.

h: And if it turns out we actually *do* act in awkward or inconsiderate ways, that's good! Then we know we should focus on improving our social skills.

h: Like starting conversations, sharing common interests, listening, empathizing, asking questions... you know...

b: ...all that stuff those counselors told us but then we forgot.

h: Yup.

# act4_alone_experiment_cheap

b: Saying "hi" to the barista isn't exactly gold-medal performance in the Social Butterfly Olympics.

h: It is for *us!*

h: In the social arena, we're not even featherweight class, we're like... atom-weight.

h: If we have to start with small, cheap wins, so be it. We gotta climb the 1st step to get to the 100th step.

b: Yeah! Maybe after saying "hi", we can advance to saying... *"how are you?"*

h: *"Not much!"*

# act4_alone_experiment_burden

b: Like maybe the barista just wants to make some dang coffee, not be an *experiment* to flatter our ego.

h: Well, if it turns out we *are* being a burden...

h: ...that's good to know, too!

h: We can then learn how to better read others' emotions, pro-actively ask people what they're comfortable with, knowing and respecting others' boundaries...

b: ...all that "inter-personal skills" crap we keep seeing in counselor brochures.

h: Yup.

# act4_bad

// callbacks

// RETROACTIVE: intrusive thoughts?

[Nah, I'm good for now.]()

# act4_something_else_2

h: Okay, I think we've talked about all our fears now.

b: Yes, there are only three fears.

h: Yup, exactly three.

b: Convenient.

# act4c

b: ...

h: ...

b: This isn't some *game*, you know.

b: Building a better relationship with your negative emotions isn't as simple as clicking buttons on a screen.

b: We'll have to practice "faking it" until we're "making it". But how long will that take? Can we keep it up?

b: Can we *really* get along, human?

b: Can we *really* act as one, as a team?

h: Well,

h2: It's just that, well, I (almost) jumped off a roof and (almost) killed myself.

h2: Please don't take it as a personal rejection, I just need quiet time to process some emotions.

// s: HOLY CRAP I KNEW IT, THEY *ARE* A DANGEROUS PSYCHO!

b: It *will* take a while. Maybe *years.* And occasionally, I'll slip into my old habits.

b: I'll bark at shadows. I'll scare you with words. I might even show you some intrusive images of... things.

b: I'm sorry! I'm a battered shelter dog! Battered dogs crap on your bed once in a while!
