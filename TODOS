- Why's there a long pause between scene transitions? // or is there with devtools OFF?

- black out, then show END SCREEN (for newsletter, patreon, in meantime my other games)

- if can contain code with { } regex

- hp white out

- drag through street for points

- less long . . . post-Tinder

- wait before hey human

- shaking logo (& w/ outline)

- if allows whitespace inside (space, but NOT newline)

- not Warren but textbook (which you don't read)

THANKS:
